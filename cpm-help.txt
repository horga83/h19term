Built-in commands

[items] are optional,  <items> are compulsary.

DIR [d:][filematch]           Display list of files.  <letter>*.* works
ERA [d:]<filematch>           Erase specified files.  *.* can be used.
REN [d:]new.ext = old.ext     Change file name from old.ext to new.ext
SAVE n [d:]filename.ext       Save the n number of pages of the TPA to disk.
TYPE [d:]filename.ext         List contents of the ASCII file.
USER n                        Switches to the specified user area.

Using STAT
----------
STAT B:                     Get bytes remaing on B:
STAT B:*.*                  Stat all files on B:
STAT B:BIOS.SYS $R/W        Change BIOS.SYS on B: drive to read write
STAT B:DSK:                 Get stat of disk records


Using PIP
---------
PIP [d:][newfile.ext]=[d:][filespec][<t>

Copy files between peripherals whilst performing optional conversion <t>.

PIP H:=A:INFO.DAT              Copy file from drive to drive.
PIP [A:]NEW.DAT=[A:]INFO.DAT   Copy file to new name.
PIP LST:=[A:]LETTER.TXT        Copy file to printer.

In addition, a range of parameters can be specified in square brackets [] 
immediately after the command, to perform various translations during the 
copy.

[B]	  Block Mode Transfer - Copy data in blocks, used with paper tape.

[H]	  Hex format - only allow copying of intel HEX format files.
[I]	  Ignore NULL records.
[L]	  Lower case conversion - converts all upper case to lower case.
[N]	  Number lines - Move text to start at col 9, and insert line numbers.

[O]	  Object file transfer - would otherwise break on non ascii/hex files.
[R]	  Read System Files - read and copy system, sets [W]
[Qstring^Z]	  Stop copying at specified string, ^Z refers to CTRL-Z
[Sstring^Z]	  Start copying at specified string
[Tn]  TAB setting - move tab settings of file to columns, n, 1n, 2n, 3n etc.
[Gn]  Transfer from user area n to current area
[Dn]  Truncate file at column n
[U]	  Uppercase conversion - the opposite of [L]
[V]	  Verify the copy
[W]	  Write to a readonly file
[Z]	  Zero parity setting - Set highest (parity) bit of every byte to 0.
