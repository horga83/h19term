 INSTALLATION
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Please take note of the MANDATORY step below.

 H19term is written in Python and currently uses version 3.6 or greater.  
 I have found  this to be installed on all Linux distributions to date so you 
 shouldn't have to install it. 
 
 I have tried to keep the requirements to a minimum so the only other package
 you should require is the PySerial module. Please note that as of the release 
 of Python 3.x there are now packages specific to the Python version, make 
 sure you install the correct one.
 
 
 Untar H19term
 --------------
 Next extract the h19term-install.tar.gz to either your home directory or 
 alternatively any directory you like.  You can delete the files after so an 
 temporary folder maybe be best.
 
  You should end up with the following files from the tar ball:
   h19term-distribution.tar.gz
   install.sh
   INSTALLATION.txt
   README.md
   uninstall.sh


Run the Install
---------------
Open a terminal in the folder where you unzipped the files and type 
"sudo ./install.sh" at the prompt, or you can become the "root" user and 
run it.


Setup Terminal
--------------------

********************************************************************

**  MUST READ IMPORTANT!!!!
**  MANDATORY STEP.
**
********************************************************************

YOU MUST setup an H8 profile for your terminal.  I use Gnome-Terminal but 
you may use Mate-Terminal, KDE Konsole or XFCE Terminal.  XFCE4-Terminal
doesn't allow profiles, too bad.

Go to the Preferences in your terminal of choice and add an "H8" profile.

Set these things in your profile or terminal:
 Size:      - Must be 82x31 at least, larger looks odd but it will work.
 Font:      - Set the font to Heathkit-H19-bitmap or Heathkit-H19.
 Backspace: - Set Backspace to generate Control-H
 Delete:    - Set Delete key to generate ASCII DEL
 
Run the program from a terminal by typing:
 
 $ h19term<enter>
 
NOTE: You MUST run H19term at least once to create an initial .h19termrc
       file.
 
You can edit the /usr/local/bin/h19term file to change your terminal
at a later date if you like.

You should be able to find H19term in your desktop menus or search 
for it by hitting the "Super" or "Windows" key and typing h19.

Enjoy.
