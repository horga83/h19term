 INSTALLATION
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 H19term is written in Python and currently uses version 3.6 or greater.  
 I have found  this to be installed on all Linux distributions to date so you 
 shouldn't have to install it. 
 
 I have tried to keep the requirements to a minimum so the only other package
 you should require is the PySerial module. Please note that as of the release 
 of Python 3.x there are now packages specific to the Python version, make 
 sure you install the correct one.
 
 
 Raspberry Pi Installs:
 --------------------------
 If you are running on a RASPBERRY PI you MUST run the 
 h19term-raspi-install.sh script instead.

  
 Desktop Linux Installs:
 --------------------------
 
 Install PySerial
 ----------------
 Raspbian, Debian, Ubuntu and Mint users can easily install this with the 
 following command:
   sudo apt-get install python3-serial

 Arch and Manjaro users install with:
   sudo pacman -S python-pyserial
 
 Fedora and other RPM distros seach for pyserial.
 
 Unzip H19term
 --------------
 Next unzip the h19term.zip to either your home directory or alternatively 
 any directory you like. If you want to install it somewhere other than 
 /usr/local/, you will need to adjust the "installpath" setting in your 
 .h19termrc file and edit the install script or install manually.
 
 NOTE: You MUST run H19term at least once to create an initial .h19termrc file.
 
 You should end up with the following files from the tar ball:
   h19-readme.txt
   h19-keys.odt
   ascii.txt
   beep1.wav
   h19term
   h19term.py
   h19term.xpm
   h19term.desktop
   h19term-raspi-install.sh
   install.sh
   cpm-help.txt
   H19term16x32.psfu.gz
   H19term14x28.psfu.gz
   H19term12x24.psfu.gz
   H19term10x20.psfu.gz
   Heathkit-H19-bitmap.otb

Run the Install
---------------
Open a terminal in the folder where you unzipped the files and type 
"sudo ./install.sh" at the prompt, or you can become the "root" user and 
run it.

Setup Terminal
--------------------
I use Gnome Terminal and setup an H8 profile for it.  XFCE Terminal doesn't 
seem to allow profiles, too bad.  KDE console does I believe.

You can edit the /usr/local/bin/h19term file to change your terminal.

Set these things in your profile or terminal:
 Size:      - Must be 82x31 at least, larger looks odd but it will work.
 Font:      - Set the font to Heathkit-H19-bitmap
 Backspace: - Set Backspace to generate Control-H
 Delete:    - Set Delete key to generate ASCII DEL
 
 
Run the program from a terminal by typing:
 
 $ h19term<enter>
 
You should be able to find H19term in your desktop menus or search 
for it by hitting the "Super" or "Windows" key and typing h19.

Enjoy.
