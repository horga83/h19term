 INSTALLATION
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 H19term is written in Python and currently uses version 3.6 or greater.  
 I have found  this to be installed on all Linux distributions to date so you 
 shouldn't have to install it. 
 
 I have tried to keep the requirements to a minimum so the only other package
 you should require is the PySerial module. Please note that as of the release 
 of Python 3.x there are now packages specific to the Python version, make 
 sure you install the correct one.
 
 
 Raspberry Pi Installs:
 ----------------------
 If you are running on a RASPBERRY PI you can run the 
 h19term-raspi-install.sh script.  This script assumes you are running
 RASPBIAN on your Pi.

  
 Non Raspberry Pi Installs:
 --------------------------
 
 Install PySerial
 ----------------
 Raspbian, Debian, Ubuntu and Mint users can easily install this with the 
 following command:
   sudo apt-get install python3-serial

 Arch and Manjaro users install with:
   sudo pacman -S python-pyserial
 
 Fedora and other RPM distros seach for pyserial.
 
 Untar H19term
 --------------
 Next unzip the h19term.zip to either your home directory or alternatively 
 any directory you like. If you want to install it somewhere other than 
 your $HOME, you will need to adjust the "installpath" setting in your 
 .h19termrc file.  
 
 NOTE: You MUST run H19term at least once to create an initial .h19termrc file.
 
 You should end up with the following files from the tar ball:
   h19-readme.txt
   h19-keys.odt
   ascii.txt
   beep1.wav
   h19term.py
   cpm-help.txt
   H19term16x32.psfu.gz
   H19term14x28.psfu.gz
   H19term12x24.psfu.gz
   H19term10x20.psfu.gz
 
 Make it executable
 ------------------    
 Make the h19term.py file executable with the "chmod" command:
   chmod +x h19term.py
 
 Run the program from a terminal or Linux console by typing:
 
 $ ./h19term.py<enter>
