 INSTALLATION
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Please take note of the MANDATORY step below.

 H19term is written in Python and currently uses version 3.6 or greater.  
 I have found  this to be installed on all Linux distributions to date so you 
 shouldn't have to install it. 
 
 I have tried to keep the requirements to a minimum and the install.sh script
 should install all dependencies. 

 
 Untar H19term
 --------------
 Next extract the h19term-install.tar.gz to either your home directory or 
 alternatively any directory you like.  You can delete the files after so an 
 temporary folder maybe be best.
 
  You should end up with the following files from the tar ball:
   h19term-distribution.tar.gz
   install.sh
   INSTALLATION.txt
   README.md
   uninstall.sh


Run the Install
---------------
Open a terminal in the folder where you unzipped the files and type 
"sudo ./install.sh" at the prompt.


Setup Terminal
--------------------

********************************************************************
**
**  MUST READ IMPORTANT!!!!
**  MANDATORY STEP.
**
********************************************************************

YOU MUST setup an H8 profile for your terminal.  I use Gnome-Terminal but 
you may use Mate-Terminal, KDE Konsole or XFCE Terminal.  XFCE4-Terminal
doesn't allow profiles, too bad.

Go to the Preferences in your terminal of choice and add an "H8" profile.

Set these things in your profile or terminal:
 Size:      - Must be 82x31 at least, larger looks odd but it will work.
 Font:      - Set the font to Heathkit-H19-bitmap or Heathkit-H19.
 Backspace: - Set Backspace to generate Control-H
 Delete:    - Set Delete key to generate ASCII DEL
 
Run the program from a terminal by typing:
 
 $ h19term<enter>
 
NOTE: You MUST run H19term at least once to create an initial .h19termrc
       file.
 
You can edit the /usr/local/bin/h19term file to change your terminal
at a later date if you like.

You should be able to find H19term in your desktop menus or search 
for it by hitting the "Super" or "Windows" key and typing h19.

If you experience trouble, open a terminal of at least 82x31 characters 
in size and type: /usr/local/bin/h19term.py.  This should display any
error messages without the window going away.


Serial Port Permissions
-----------------------

You must be a member of the proper group to read and write to a serial 
Port under Linux.  Debian/Ubuntu/Mint use the DIALOUT group and 
Arch/Manjaro uses the UUCP group.

The install.sh script should have added you to the DIALOUT group or 
UUCP group depending on whether you run Debian/Ubuntu/Mint based 
Linux or Arch/Manjaro Linux.  You may have to REBOOT for this to take 
effect.

You will, at the very least, have to logout and login again.
If you run the "groups" command and DO NOT see your group, then
you will have to reboot.


XMODEM Autorun support
----------------------
If you are going to use Autorun copy the RX.COM file to your CP/M machine
Even if you don't use the Autorun feature, RX.COM is a great xmodem receive
command.  9600baud on a 2MHz Z80 and 19200 on a 4MHz Z80.
RX.COM can be found in /usr/local/share/h19term


Enjoy.
