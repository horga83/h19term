 H19term aims to provide close to 100 percent software emulation of the
 Heathkit H19, also known as Zenith Z19, hardware video terminal. 

 **Latest version V2.4**

 It currently has the following features:
 
   - Software bell - User configurable sound
   - Heath mode
   - Ansi mode
   - Supports 25th line.
   - Support all graphics characters.
   - Custom font files for the Linux console, includes Raspberry Pi
   - Custom font for X11 based terminals such as gnome-terminal
   - Serial Port logging.
   - Selectable serial ports and baud rates
   - Easily configurable in .h19termrc file
   - Colour changing mode for Amber and Green or other colours.
   - Xmodem transfer with H8/H89 companion app (RX.COM)
   - Help files directly inside h19term.
     - Ascii table
     - User Manual
     - CP/M quick help.
   
 Runs on the Linux console or in most X11 terminal emulators such as
 gnome-terminal and xterm.  I have found that the terminal in XFCE does
 not work as well.
